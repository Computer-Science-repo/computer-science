### 1. CSE 373 -- Lecture 1, Fall 2020

- What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.\
  An algorithm is the idea behind any reasonable computer program.
- There are three desirable properties for a good algorithm. We seek algorithms that are **correct** and **efficient**, while being **easy to implement**.

- 1.1. Robot Tour Optimization (p. 5)

  - Take-Home Lesson: There is a fundamental difference between algorithms, which always produce a correct result,and heuristics, which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.

- 1.2 Selecting the Right Jobs (p. 9)
